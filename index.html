                <p>I am a software engineering student. I hope to one day be a fullstack developer and a machine learning developer. I attended De Anza community college 
                    for 5 years getting my AS in business and computer science. I am currently attending Thinkful, where I am planning on becoming a full-fledged 
                    developer.

                <p>I am currently located in North West Arkansas. However, I was born in Santa Clara, California.
                    But I like to say I am from Colorado Springs, Colorado. It's confusing, but I 
                    spent majority of my childhood in Colorado Springs. Eventually when I become a full-fledged 
                    developer I hope to be able to travel while working. My dream place to live is somewhere quiet 
                    with beautiful scenary, I just have to go out and find that somewhere.

                <p>I love to program, and not only that, I love to learn. Learning is an absolute passion of mine. Sometimes it takes me a while to understand 
                    something but I will never give up trying to. On top of that I love helping people who just want to learn.</p>

            <div class="item">
                <p>I surf the web, and I copy the web. Whatever I find cool, I just have to learn how to make it. A huge interest of mine is machine learning apps. 
                    The ones where there is detection, pattern recognition, captchas. But for right now, I just feel like first becoming a full-stack developer would 
                    be a big step towards learning how to develop. Then later on in my very long career in developing I could step over to machine learning.

                <p>My favorite application I worked on was with a team. The application is for a book store management.
                    There were 4 total people and it took a total of 10 hours for us to code. I had a ton of fun collaborating with other people.

            <div class="item">
                <p>I am a big gamer. I love playing FPS (first-person shooter) games and survival games. My favorite game right now would be 
                    Valorant, which is an FPS.  However as of lately I have been really big on running and biking. Where I live, there is tons of places 
                    to hike and bike. So I am never gonna run out of places to see.</p>

                <p>I would love to eventually provide clients with full built apps for their businesses or their personal needs. Eventually I would love to build or work on 
                    machine learning apps.</p>
